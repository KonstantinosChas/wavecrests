# wavecrests
This is a program and routines to image process oceanic breaking waves, their geometry and kinematics

Main input data are images of breaking wave crests - preferably laser lit.
Images should be calibrated with calibration.m before further analysed. 

Main program (wave_crests.m) handles functions and outputs figures and meta-data of geometry and kinematics of breaking wave profiles

Functions can be commented to not be used. 

Further tasks:
1. write routine for plotting
2. clear useful functions from obsolete (not many)
3. add functions for more advanced stastistics
